Just some simple JavaScript scripts that I've made

## How to use
For bookmarks, copy the text from the txt files in the *bookmarks* directory and paste them into the URL input in your browser's edit bookmark dialog.

You can also run the scripts in your browser's JavaScript console by pasting the text from the js files in the *scripts* directory.

## What they do
* google - opens your query in a new tab
* long-div - uses long division between two numbers and gives you the quotient and remainder
* open-text - opens whatever text you enter (in HTML formatting) in a new window
* random - two scripts that either give you a random integer or a rational number from 0-1000
